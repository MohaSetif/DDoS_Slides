## Attack Stages

The execution of a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack typically involves several distinct phases, each with its own objectives and strategies. Here are the common phases of a DDoS attack:

    - Reconnaissance.
    - Botnet Building.
    - Weaponization.
    - Command and Control (C&C).
    - Launch.
    - Sustainment.
    - Evasion and Camouflage.
    - Monitoring.
    - Post-Attack Activities.
    - Cleanup.
