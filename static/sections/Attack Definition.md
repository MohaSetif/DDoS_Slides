## DDoS: Distributed Denial of Service

- **Defintion:** A distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack is a malicious attempt to make an online service unavailable to users, usually by temporarily interrupting or suspending the services of its hosting server.
    
- A DDoS attack is launched from numerous compromised devices, often distributed globally in what is referred to as a botnet. It is distinct from other denial of service (DoS) attacks in that it uses a single Internet-connected device (one network connection) to flood a target with malicious traffic. This nuance is the main reason for the existence of these two somewhat different definitions.
