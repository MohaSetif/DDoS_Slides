## DDoS' History

The history of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks spans several decades and has evolved alongside advancements in technology and the internet. Here's a brief history of DDoS attacks:

**Early Days (1980s-1990s)**:
The concept of DoS (Denial of Service) attacks existed in the early days of the internet.
These attacks were typically launched by sending excessive traffic to overwhelm a target server or network, rendering it inaccessible.

**1990s**:
DDoS attacks started to gain prominence in the late 1990s.
The first major case of a DDoS attack that made headlines occurred in 1999 when Canadian computer scientist Michael Calce, known as "Mafiaboy," launched a series of DDoS attacks against high-profile websites, including Yahoo, eBay, and CNN.
Calce's attacks were carried out by commandeering a network of compromised computers to flood the target sites with traffic.



**2000s**:
DDoS attacks continued to evolve, becoming more sophisticated and damaging.
Botnets, which are networks of compromised devices controlled by a single entity, became a common tool for launching DDoS attacks.
Attackers started using amplification techniques, like DNS amplification, to increase the volume of attack traffic.

**Mid-2000s**:
Hacktivist groups and individuals began using DDoS attacks as a form of protest or to promote their agendas.
Notable incidents included attacks by groups like Anonymous, which targeted organizations and websites they deemed unethical or oppressive.

**2010s**:
DDoS attacks became even more powerful, with attackers using massive botnets to execute record-breaking attacks.
The Internet of Things (IoT) emerged as a new attack vector. In 2016, the Mirai botnet, composed of compromised IoT devices, launched a massive DDoS attack against Dyn, a major DNS service provider, causing widespread internet outages.

**Recent Years (2020s)**:
DDoS attacks remain a significant threat to online services, businesses, and organizations.
Attackers continue to adapt their techniques to evade detection and mitigation.
Businesses and security providers invest in more robust DDoS protection measures to defend against increasingly complex attacks.



## Examples of Previous DDoS Attacks

**Dyn DDoS Attack (2016)**:
Attack: In October 2016, the Mirai botnet launched a massive DDoS attack against Dyn, a major DNS service provider. The attack targeted Dyn's DNS infrastructure, resulting in widespread internet outages, affecting major websites and services.
Response and Measures Taken:
Dyn responded by implementing traffic filtering and rerouting to mitigate the attack.
The incident raised awareness about the vulnerability of IoT devices and the need for better security measures.
Collaboration between organizations and service providers intensified to share threat intelligence and combat botnet-based attacks more effectively.



**GitHub DDoS Attack (2018)**:
Attack: In February 2018, GitHub, a widely used code hosting platform, was hit by a powerful DDoS attack. The attack peaked at 1.35 Tbps and was one of the largest DDoS attacks at the time.
Response and Measures Taken:
GitHub quickly implemented DDoS mitigation measures, which included routing traffic through Prolexic (a DDoS protection service), to absorb and filter malicious traffic.
GitHub engineers collaborated with ISPs and DDoS protection providers to effectively counter the attack.
The incident highlighted the importance of having robust DDoS protection measures in place for online services.



**Estonian Cyberattacks (2007)**:
Attack: In 2007, Estonia experienced a series of cyberattacks, including DDoS attacks, which targeted government and financial institutions. These attacks were believed to be politically motivated.
Response and Measures Taken:
Estonia responded by temporarily blocking all foreign internet traffic to protect essential services.
The government worked on enhancing cybersecurity and collaboration with international partners.
The incident led to increased international focus on cybersecurity and a recognition of the potential impact of politically motivated DDoS attacks.



**ProtonMail DDoS Attacks (2015)**:
Attack: ProtonMail, a secure email service, was targeted by a series of DDoS attacks in November 2015. These attacks disrupted its services and were allegedly linked to an online extortion attempt.
Response and Measures Taken:
ProtonMail collaborated with DDoS mitigation service providers, including Radware, to mitigate the attacks.
The incident highlighted the importance of implementing DDoS protection and maintaining good communication with customers during an attack.
ProtonMail also established a crowdfunding campaign to raise funds for enhanced DDoS protection.
